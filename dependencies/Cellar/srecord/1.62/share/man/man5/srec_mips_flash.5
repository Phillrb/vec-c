.SH NAME
srec_mips_flash \- MIPS\[hy]Flash file format
.if require_index \{
.\}
.SH DESCRIPTION
The MIPS SDE tool chain has a \f[I]convert\fP program that is able to
output this format.  I have no idea what reads it, some kind of flash
programmer I suppose.
.SS Format
The file must start with '!R' to reset the state machine.
White space appears to be ignored, except as it serves to separate tokens.
.PP
Data is presented as 32\[hy]bit hexadecimal numbers, in the normal
big\[hy]endian text number format.  To write them to memory, you have to
know if the target is big\[hy]endian or little\[hy]endian. for little endian
targets, reverse the order of the bytes in this number.
.PP
The eight bytes following a '>' are a sort of comment.  The SDE code
reads like they are displayed in the flash programmer as a kind of
progress indicator.
.PP
The number following '@' is a new address for the following data.
.PP
Each segment must be erased before it can be written, this is done with
the '!E' command.  Each segment is assumed to be 128kB in size.
.PP
Special segments must unlocked (with the '!C' command) and locked again
(with the '!S' command).
.PP
This file format contains no checksum mechanism.
.PP
.SS Command Line Options
This format is specified using one of the \fB\-Mips\[hy]Flash\[hy]Big_Endian\fP
or \fB\-Mips\[hy]Flash\[hy]Little_Endian\fP options.  The endian\[hy]ness must
be specified on the command line, because there is nothing in the file contents
to indicate the endian\[hy]ness of the data it contains.
.SS Size Multiplier
In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 2.3 times
when represented with this format (worse if you use shorter lines).

.SH EXAMPLE
Here is an example MIPS\[hy]Flash file.
It contains the data \[lq]Hello, World\[rq] to be loaded at bytes address 0x0000
(but remember, the file contents are always multiples of four bytes).
