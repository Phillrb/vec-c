.TH \*(n) 5 SRecord "Reference Manual"
.SH NAME
srec_spasm \- SPASM file format
.if require_index \{
.\}
.SH DESCRIPTION
This format is the output of the Paralax SPASM assembler
(now defunct, I'm told).
The file contains two columns of 16\[hy]bit hexadecimal coded values.
The first column is the word address, the second column is the word data.
.PP
By default, SRecord treats this is big\[hy]endian data (the most
significant byte first).  If you want little endian order,
use the \-spasm\[hy]le argument instead.
.SS Size Multiplier
In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 5.0 times
when represented with this format (5.5 times in Windows).

.SH EXAMPLE

It contains the data \[lq]Hello, World[rq] to be loaded at bytes address 0x0100
