// Used for custom tunes.
// These pieces of music include the adsr and twang headers and then the music data
//

//Music data bytes: ;
//  Bits 0-5 = frequency ;
//  Bit 6 clear = tone ;
//  Bit 6 set = noise ;
//  Bit 7 set = next music data byte is for next channel ;
//  Bit 7 clear, play note with duration in next music data byte: ;
//  bits 0-5 = duration ;
//  bit 6 = unused ;
//  bit 7 set = end of music ;

#define N(x) 64+x   //Use 'noise' instead of 'tone' (Bit 6)
#define _ +128      //Inform that the next byte is for next channel (Bit 7)

//The ADSR table is simply 32 nibbles (16 bytes) of amplitude values.
//The ADSR table sets up a 'fading' of the notes
//E.G. PONG bleeps are abrubt but an organ is long

//The twang table is 8 signed bytes to modify the base frequency of
//each note being played. Each channel has a different limit to its
//twang table index (6-8) to keep them out of phase to each other.
//usually just all 0 bytes
//Vibrato
